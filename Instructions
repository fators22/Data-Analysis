Stop word removal is the process of removing commonly used words from a list before or after processing text.

Find and remove stop words from a social media post.

In TextProcessor.java:
Write the method removeStopWords() to find and remove all occurrences of each stop word in the stopWords list from the textList.

Traverse the stopWords list and the textList list.

If the current word in stopWords is found in textList, use the remove() method in the ArrayList class to remove the word from textList.

In Main Method:
Call the removeStopWords() method on myText with the stopWords list.

Print the updated TextProcessor object.
